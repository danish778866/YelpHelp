# Description
This repo includes scripts used to find insights on yelp restaurant dataset

# Script
Script folder includes correlation queries ('C' series) and aggregation queries ('A' series)

# Correlation Queries :
C1: Find the correlation between a restaurant's rating and its attributes. For instance, is there any correlation between parking, takeout service and cuisine?

C2: Find the correlation between a restaurant business and the location. For instance, how popular the restaurant business is in a particular geographical location?

C3: Combine users and reviews and business data to see if we can find something interesting there. For instance, does the user prefers restaurants with useful ratings or does user concentrate only on the rating of the business? Are there any outliers in the data?


# Aggregation Queries:
A1: List the top 100 best restaurants in a particular location with a specified rating.

A2: List top 100 restaurants with takeout facility and specific rating.

A3: List restaurants who are running low on business with horrible ratings.
